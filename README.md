# **ImpactDerivativesFHE: A DEX for Encrypted Impact Derivatives Trading**

ImpactDerivativesFHE is a cutting-edge decentralized exchange (DEX) that empowers the trading of FHE-encrypted "impact derivatives" tied to regenerative finance (ReFi) projects. Built on **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**, this platform allows users to transact in futures and options contracts tied to future verifiable "impact outputs" from projects like carbon capturing and biodiversity preservation—all while maintaining comprehensive privacy.

## **The Problem: Addressing Transparency in Impact Investing**

Investors today face a critical challenge: how to securely engage in impact investing while ensuring transparency and verification of outcomes. Traditional financial systems lack the tools to provide confidentiality and security for sensitive data, leaving investors vulnerable to potential breaches and mismanagement. Impact derivatives, which offer financial instruments based on environmental and societal impacts, often struggle to gain traction due to these transparency and trust issues.

## **The FHE Solution: Secure and Private Transactions**

Using Zama's open-source libraries, including **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, ImpactDerivativesFHE leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption to address the pressing need for privacy in financial transactions. With this innovative technology, sensitive data remains encrypted throughout its lifecycle, allowing trading participants to engage in pricing and risk management without exposing their underlying data. This not only elevates trust among investors but also fosters a more inclusive approach to impact investing.

## **Core Features of ImpactDerivativesFHE**

- **FHE-Encrypted Trading:** All derivative trades on the platform are encrypted using FHE, ensuring complete confidentiality.
- **Impact-Focused Derivatives:** Trade futures or options contracts linked to measurable impacts of ReFi projects.
- **Dynamic Pricing Models:** The DEX offers sophisticated analytics tools to assist in the evaluation of risk and return on impact investments.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A professional derivatives trading interface designed for ease of use while accommodating advanced functionality.

## **Technology Stack**

- **Zama's FHE SDK (Concrete and TFHE-rs):** Core libraries for implementing Fully Homomorphic Encryption.
- **Solidity:** Smart contract language for creating the trading platform on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for the backend.
- **Hardhat:** Development environment for compiling and testing smart contracts.

## **Getting Started with ImpactDerivativesFHE**

Before you can dive into using ImpactDerivativesFHE, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **Hardhat** or **Foundry**

### Installation Instructions

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   
2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will fetch the required Zama FHE libraries and other dependencies.

### Building and Running the Project

To compile and deploy the contracts, run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

To run tests for your smart contracts, use:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

If you want to deploy to a test network, utilize:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

Make sure to replace `<network-name>` with the desired Ethereum test network you wish to deploy to (e.g., Rinkeby or Ropsten).

## **Example Code Snippet**

Here’s a brief example of how to interact with the `impactDerivativesFHE` smart contract using JavaScript:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const ImpactDerivativesFHE = await ethers.getContractFactory("impactDerivativesFHE");
    const contract = await ImpactDerivativesFHE.deploy();
    await contract.deployed();

    console.log("Contract deployed to:", contract.address);

    // Example of creating a new impact derivative
    const tx = await contract.createImpactDerivative("ReFi Project Financing", 1000, "Carbon Credits");
    await tx.wait();

    console.log("Impact Derivative created successfully!");
}

main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

This sample code demonstrates how to deploy your contract and create a new impact derivative, showcasing the use of the functionalities offered by ImpactDerivativesFHE.
